A Java Login Page using Swing is a GUI-based application that allows users to enter credentials and authenticate access to a system. It is created using Java Swing, a framework for building desktop applications with a graphical interface.

Key Features:
User Interface Components: Uses JFrame, JLabel, JTextField, JPasswordField, and JButton to create the login form.

Create a JFrame: Set up the main window for the login page.

Add Components: Place labels, text fields, and buttons for username and password input.

Implement Action Listener: Capture button clicks and verify login credentials.
